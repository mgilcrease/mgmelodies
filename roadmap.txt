Progressive Web Application
	* Version control
		- Allow users to control which version they want to use
		- Data migration system to handle schema updates
		- Data backup system to export projects to external storage
	* The app runs 100% in the browser. No user-generated content will ever touch the server
Collaboration Features
	* Artists can collaborate with each other using WebRTC
	* Collaboration features will be checked/unlocked via REST api
	* Social graphs are 100% stored in the browser, with no server-side knowledge
	* Artists can find other artists using server-side checks to see who else is paying for collaboration features, but all social networking relationships
	  are stored client-side. The server-side database & infrastucture has no knowledge of who collaborates with who
